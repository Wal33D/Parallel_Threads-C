# PThreads Project

Welcome to the PThreads Project repository. This project is centered around demonstrating the power and potential of POSIX Threads (PThreads) for parallel and concurrent programming in C. Through various examples and case studies, this project aims to exhibit how PThreads can be used for optimizing computational tasks and processes.

## Project Structure

Unfortunately, the detailed structure was provided in an unreadable format. However, the project typically includes:

- **src/**: Source files containing the implementation of various examples.
- **include/**: Header files with function declarations and necessary definitions.
- **examples/**: A collection of examples demonstrating different aspects and techniques of using PThreads.
- **docs/**: Documentation related to the project and its examples.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts to compile, run, and benchmark the examples.
- **tests/**: Test cases ensuring the correctness of the implementation.

## Features

This project showcases:

- Basic usage of PThreads for creating and managing threads.
- Synchronization mechanisms, including mutexes and condition variables.
- Parallel algorithms implementation.
- Performance comparison between single-threaded and multi-threaded implementations.
- Techniques to avoid common concurrency problems like deadlocks and race conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (GCC or Clang recommended).
- POSIX-compliant operating system (most Linux distributions, macOS, etc.).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/PThreads.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd PThreads
   ```

3. **Compile the examples:**

   ```bash
   make all
   ```

   This will compile all the examples and place the binaries in a designated folder.

### Running Examples

To run an example, navigate to the `build/` directory and execute the desired binary. For instance:

```bash
./build/pthreads
```

## Usage

Each example is standalone and designed to illustrate certain concepts or functionality. You may modify the source code to experiment with different aspects of PThreads. Refer to the `README.md` files in each example's directory for more specific instructions.
