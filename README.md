This is a multithreaded program that calculates various statistical values
for a list of numbers. This program will be passed a series of numbers on 
the command line and will then create three separate worker threads:

	(1) Thread 1 will determine the average of the numbers
	(2) Thread 2 will determine the maximum value
	(3) Thread 3 will determine the minimum value

GRADER PLEASE READ!
NOTE: 

I used a dynamically increasing integer array, the same array
I used in part 3 of Assignment 1, I mention this becuase my
program looks slightly different, on the cmd console, 
then the demo we were provided Instead of first specifying a # of 
elements for the array my array size increases as needed.
