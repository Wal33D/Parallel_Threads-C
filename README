This is a multithreaded program that calculates various statistical values
for a list of numbers. This program will be passed a series of numbers on 
the command line and will then create three separate worker threads:

	(1) Thread 1 will determine the average of the numbers
	(2) Thread 2 will determine the maximum value
	(3) Thread 3 will determine the minimum value
